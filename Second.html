  <p class="name">This is my personal website, I was born on the 24th of January 2003. I'm currently studying at Adamson University, and my course is BS IT. I was inspired to create programs thanks to my love for gaming and seeing it's production makes it even better. I want to be a great game developer some day,
But I'm currently focused on my studies and friends right now, and I intend to finish my college years nomally just like everybody. </p>
